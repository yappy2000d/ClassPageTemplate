## Introduction
Excluding my past experience in writing web crawlers, this is my first contact with Front End, so I have to learn a new field by myself. Facing unfamiliar grammar and structure will test my ability to solve problems when facing new things.

## Experience
With tools, we can quickly build products on the basis of our predecessors.Quoted from the Wiki's explanation of the software framework: using tools is like performing on a stage set up by others, easy but not simple.

## Procedure
This is a brief record of the difficulties I encountered in the process.

### Goal
Create a static website template that introduces the class. This time I will mainly use Bootstrap Studio to set up. Try not to use the template. Instead, use more basic elements to compile a website structure, and then fill in the randomly generated text to complete a template.

### Process
Since my JavaScript is poor, I won't use it this time. Mainly use HTML as the framework, and then add CSS to embellish it. Because it is using a tool, there is no explanation of the grammar. It's mainly in the part of thinking and the attitude of solving problems.

#### Idea
Original design:
Problem
The main reason is that I want the main menu and menu to remain on the screen, but because it requires JavaScript, I abandoned this method.

New idea:
This time itâ€™s all made statically, so it won't involve issues like JavaScript and JQuery

#### Making
Create a blank template.

Divide the block and plan the publication.
Use HTML to create rows and columns, and CSS styles to divide blocks and positions.

Fill in the elements and limit the height of the button
Problem
I found that the top of the page could not be aligned when filling in elements

So I decided to remove the header image from the field and use displacement alignment
